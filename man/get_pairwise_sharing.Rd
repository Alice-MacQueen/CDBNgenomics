\title{Compute the proportion of (significant) signals shared by magnitude in each pair of conditions, based on the poterior mean}
\usage{
get_pairwise_sharing(m, factor = 0.5, lfsr_thresh = 0.05, FUN = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the mash fit}

\item{factor}{a number between 0 and 1 - the factor within which effects are
considered to be shared.}

\item{lfsr_thresh}{the lfsr threshold for including an effect in the
assessment}

\item{FUN}{a function to be applied to the estimated effect sizes before
assessing sharing. The most obvious choice beside the default
'FUN=identity' would be 'FUN=abs' if you want to ignore the sign of the
effects when assesing sharing.}
}
\description{
Compute the proportion of (significant) signals shared by magnitude in each pair of conditions, based on the poterior mean
}
\details{
For each pair of tissues, first identify the effects that are
    significant (by lfsr<lfsr_thresh) in at least one of the two tissues.
    Then compute what fraction of these have an estimated (posterior mean)
    effect size within a factor `factor` of one another. The results are
    returned as an R by R matrix.

\examples{
\dontrun{
get_pairwise_sharing(m) # sharing by magnitude (same sign)
get_pairwise_sharing(m, factor=0) # sharing by sign
get_pairwise_sharing(m, FUN=abs) # sharing by magnitude when sign is ignored
}
