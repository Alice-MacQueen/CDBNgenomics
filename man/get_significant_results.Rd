\title{From a mash result, get effects that are significant in at least one condition}
\usage{
get_significant_results(m, thresh = 0.05, conditions = NULL,
  sig_fn = ashr::get_lfsr)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the mash result (from joint or 1by1 analysis)}

\item{thresh}{indicates the threshold below which to call signals significant}

\item{conditions}{which conditions to include in check (default to all)}

\item{sig_fn}{the significance function used to extract significance from mash object; eg could be ashr::get_lfsr or ashr::get_lfdr. (Small values must indicate significant.)}
}
\value{
a vector containing the indices of the significant effects, by order of most significant to least
}
\description{
From a mash result, get effects that are significant in at least one condition
}
