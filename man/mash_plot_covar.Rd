\title{ggplot of covariance matrix masses}
\usage{
mash_plot_covar(m, saveoutput = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{An object of type mash}

\item{saveoutput}{Logical. Should the output be saved to the path?}
}
\description{
Creates a bar plot using ggplot of the masses that are on each
    covariance matrix specified in the mash model.
}
\note{
This plot can be useful for seeing the overall patterns of effects in
    the data used in mash. Non-significant effects will add mass to the
    "no_effects" covariance matrix, while significant effects will add mass
    to one of the other covariance matrices. You can use GGally::ggcorr() to
    plot the covariance matrix patterns themselves.
