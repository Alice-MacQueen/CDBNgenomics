\usage{
get_log10bf(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the mash result (from joint or 1by1 analysis); must have been computed using usepointmass=TRUE}
}
\value{
if m was fitted using usepointmass=TRUE then returns a vector of
    the log10(bf) values for each effect. That is, the jth element
    lbf_j is log10(Pr(Bj | g=ghat-nonnull)/Pr(Bj | g = 0)) where gha
    t-nonnull is the non-null part of ghat.  Otherwise returns NULL.
